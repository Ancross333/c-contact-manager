Project Blueprint Example: Contact List Manager

Hereâ€™s a breakdown to help you get started quickly:

1. Plan

Define struct Contact { char name[50]; char phone[15]; }.

Decide on functions:

add_contact(...)

delete_contact(...)

print_contacts(...)

Use a fixed-size array (e.g., max 10 contacts).

2. Implement Core Logic

Start with main() that loops showing a menu:

Add Contact

Delete Contact

List Contacts

Exit

3. Handle I/O & Edge Cases

Validate if list is full before adding.

Handle empty slots when deleting.

Prompt meaningful messages.

4. Polish & Document

Comment your code.

Add a README explaining:

Compilation (gcc contact_manager.c -o cm)

How to run (./cm)

Features.

5. Version Control

Commit early and often.

Push to GitHub (project name: c-contact-manager).

6. Test

Try adding, deleting, listing multiple scenarios to verify correctness.
